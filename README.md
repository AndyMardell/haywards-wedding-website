# Hayward's Wedding Website ðŸ’’

A [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) site for the Hayward's wedding using
[React Spring](https://www.react-spring.io/) for animation, shipped with
[Zeit](https://zeit.co).

[Visit the live site ðŸ”—](https://mrandmrshayward.com)

_Disclaimer: this is not an invitation. Please don't come to the wedding unless
you were actually invited by the Bride and Groom. Okay, cool._

## Development ðŸ‘·

I'd rather you didn't deploy this site since, you know, it's my friends'
wedding site. I'm open sourcing in case anyone is interested and feels like
critiquing my code (I'm joking, please be nice to me).

```bash
npm i
gatsby develop
```

## Production ðŸš€

This is deployed using [Zeit](https://zeit.co) so a push to master will trigger
a deployment.
